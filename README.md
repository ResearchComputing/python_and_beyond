# Python and Beyond: Installing Software on Alpine Using Conda, Mamba, and uv (a Primer)

Research software is often complex and difficult to manage, particularly on shared High-Performance Computing systems like the Alpine cluster. Conda is an open-source software and environment management system that makes it easy to install complex software packages and their dependencies. Conda supports multiple languages and is particularly well-suited for managing Python and R software environments.

In this Primer* we will cover using Conda, and its newer, faster relative, “Mamba”, to create Python and R environments on the Alpine cluster.

Additionally, we’ll introduce you to uv and demonstrate how it works on CURC’s HPC system. We'll cover uv’s core features, including uv pip, uv venv and uv tool. We’ll also touch on how uv compares to traditional tools like pip and conda.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to: understand what Anaconda/Mamba do, the benefits of Anaconda and Mamba, when to use Anaconda and Mamba, and how to create environments and install software in Anaconda and Mamba. You'll also have a clear understanding of how to get started using uv to manage Python packages efficiently on an HPC system.

In order to follow along with the hands-on component of this workshop, you’ll want to have a Research Computing account. If you need assistance with this, you can attend CRDDS Office Hours on a Tuesday or Thursday before this course, or email rc-help@colorado.edu.

*What is a Primer? A Primer is a session that provides an introduction to concepts, systems, and tools. You can expect to leave "Primers" with an introductory-level understanding of the topic.
